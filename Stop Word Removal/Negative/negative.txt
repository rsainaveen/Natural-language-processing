-	Am very much disappointed with battery life of this beautiful phone , 
-	phone getting hot when use
-	My battery get drain fast at the time of phone not in use
-	Im Having the same issue on my D855 .  Battery seems to drain faster when not using the fone .  Fully Charged it Went from 100% to 85% overnight with battery on . 
- 	I noticed within the first hour of using the phone for a 5 minute conversation ,  the phone heated up really fast and my friend reported poor sound quality
-	it is really slow i am very disappointed .  Is there any solution to make it fast   ?    
-	Lg g3 really fast heating when u play games or using it hard just for 10 or 15 minutes .  .  The display is too nice for playing games but the battery is drained so fast .  .  And hot .  Interface a little bit laggy sometimes . 
-	Screened cracked by itself and when I tell people they think I'm making it up .  The phone got really hot and after sometime found dent right in the middle of the screen .  I love this phone but that was a major drawback for me . 
-	My G3 doesn't drain much in standby
-	My battery also died in 6 month usage ,  suddenly restart during taking picture and after that reboot every after loading home screen
-	Its a good media consumption phone ,  thats all ,  my battery died after 8 mounths of use (  bad ,  very bad lg )  ,  the 2k screen takes all the juice very fast ,  i changed for a low resolution smartphone with only 1500mah and it last longer than my lg g3 for 1 / 5 of its price . 
-	This fone is not short on specs has everything .  Battery isnt the best but i get just over a day on moderate usage
- 	Overheating and worst battery backup 
-	lg g3 really fast heating when u play games or using it hard just for 10 or 15 minutes , and the battery is drained so fast .  . 
-	Lg g3 is the worst phone !  It gets hot and it has burnt through a 60 . 00+ bag and a 30 . 00+ wallet .  .  .  Att has to send me the same phone and they won't replace my items or give me the money to buy new items !  !  DON'T BUT THE LG G3 ! 
-	G3's  ( D855 )  software and speed are very good .  Design is not bad to see but it make hard to handle the phone . 
-	If you don't have a satisfactory income any damage towards the touch glass ,  lcd screen or the front panel makes you finantially tight .  Because repairing costs  & #8377 ;  6300 - 7000 . 
-	The sad thing is that the touch screen can't sustain more than 3 falls .  Also camera software is not satisfactory . 
- 	am useing lg g3 d855 it's features is nice but it has 3000mah battery but Drain fast and other problem is heating .  this 2 things down the lg g3 quality otherwise its QHD display . battery is sucks this phone
-	I'm using it last 10 months .  Broken the touch 2 times and cost  & #8377 ;  13k for repair . 
-	I have used an LG G3 D855 32gb for 10 months and have never had less than a day out of a single battery charge apart from when I am flying and I use the video for a couple of movies on the plane .  I have a small external battery back-up which I have used on those occasions . 
-	Did hard reset 3 times .  .  . no improvement .  .  . battery drain lot in phone idle  .  . paricular at night .  .  . 
-	my lg g3 which i had bought in september 2014 is getting a lot of problems the apps have just and on the mobile it is coming that if u quit safe mode the apps will be restored when iam quitting nothing of such sort is happening and the volume rockers at the back are not working and also it is getting heating issues  . So in the end i feel it was a wrong decision to buy the lg g3 for me . 
-	I have been using my G3 for 3 months now and the only downside for me is it tents to get a little hot and I do hope im getting android 6 . 0
-	i got my g3 a month ago and i was starting to regret buying this phone too ,  but i found a solution for that battery life issue .  .  i lowered the brightness to 60% ,  closed and uninstall running apps  ( these apps continues on running even if its closed or not used atm )  and installed DU Battery saver .  .  now im loving my phone .  .  slept 6-8hrs with 100% battery and waking up with 99-98% and with moderate usage for like 7-8hours ,  i can say that this phone's battery life is way more better than iphones and samsung in my opinion specially when going outside for whole day .  .  the only thing that bothers me with this phone is the heating issue when playing games on g3  . 
-	Im having the same problem .  Factory reset 3 times and the fone sucks power over night when idle .  My G3 is D855 3GB ram version and brand new less than 1 month old .  Starting to regret buying this fone cause of terrible battery life .  Solutions please !  !  ! 
-	I am using LG G3 D852 Canadian variant ,  Rooted Device and using custom rom . 
-	When I bought this phone ,  it was fine but after few weeks my phone is randomly shutting down .  I have to remove battery and reinsert it several times to power on my phone .  I did factory reset 2 days back but the problem is still there .  Kindly share your suggestions ,  how do I resolve this issue . 
-	Yes .  But LG will not listen as it is stubborn at 3 Ampere battery . 
-	Samsung note 3 and note 4 are far more better than G3 in terms of battery backup and display resolution . 
-	The biggest problem with this fone is the screen ,  it sucks up most of the battery .  LG could of just used a better 1080p panel .  I dont think this issue can be fixed with marshmellow either . 
-	G3 home screen always turns full black at least once daily .  Worst mobile ever .  S5 ,  Note 3 or Note 4 are better alternatives . 
-	I've always been loyal to LG ,  but since I got this phone I had to keep getting a refurbished one because after three months or so of having it the charging port decides not to work anymore .  It's really frustrating . 
-	Waste of money .  Do not buy one . 
-	Even i was facing restart issue ,  i visited LG Center and found that my battery was faulty .  There is not an OS issues ,  Battery gets drain due to overcharging . 
-	poor battery life and other problems arise after a month of usage . 
-	LG G3 lags a lot and has very bad battery life
-	I honestly regret buying lg g3 .  It lags a lot
-	I have LG G3 .  I advise u not to .  It lags a lot . 
-	gets hot as hell when playing intense games  (  mortal kombat x )  ,  lags pretty often ,  camera lags alot ,  also sometimes the focus just gets stuck with the flash light on .  When playing MK X i experimented freezes that wont go away ,  needed to restart the phone /  take battery out .  For me it was a complete surprise that the phone freezes alot and lags ,  dont know the cause of this ,  taking in consideration the powerful SD 801 2 . 5 ghz and the 3 Gb of ram . I really love this phone boo bad it has so many downsides . 
-	The Bad: Screen could be brighter .  Average battery life for 3000mah .  Camera could have come with more features .  Multi window should support more apps
-	i am using G3 it shutdown automatically ,  some time after pressing power buttons it turn On and some time i have to remove battery then re-plug it for turn it ON my phone battery is really good  , 
-	but the disappoint thing is the battery drainage and the heating problem
- 	recently i got update 246mb file .  .  after update battery performance not good .  . before 1 time for charging now daily 3 times .  .  very bad for update file . 
- 	My LG G3 was used for 12 months only ,  but recently found there is hardward problem when accessing any APPS ,  the screen will turn to dark without any response for a few seconds ,  the screen will turn on after pressing the back button .  I had changed a new battery and restored the mobile to factory mode several times ,  but the problem is still not cleared .  
- 	i have a problem random restart and shutdown once a day i dont know the problem .  1 to 2 times a day restart or shutdown .  its a faulty battery or software issue  ?     im on 5 . 0 . 1 version D850 .  i need some help . 
- 	I got this update as well i don't know what improvement did it make .  My phone's battery life still sucks .  I dont know when LG will release an update that will actually improve something on the Phone
- 	I take phone today ,  but there is no LTE option in networks .  I beleive that phone is for UAE but I am in Europe .  .  .   ?     and its very slow ,  comparing to G2 which I have ,  I dont know what to do   ?      ?    
- 	hey thegere .  .  .  .  If you have any problem with the device share it so others who are willing to buy it may reconsider to buy and also if have some alternative under this price range ( 250USD )  than share it will help me and others alot .  .  .  .  . THANKS
- 	I have Lg G3 for few months now .  Its very beautiful phone but has many problems mostly with battery life and overheating all the time .  My opinion is to choose something else . 
-	LAGING , LESS BATTERY TIMMING AND HEATUP .  .  . AND ABOUT THE DISPLAY THAT IT IS TOO SHARP AND IT HURTS YOUR EYES .  .  .  . I am looking for a smartphone with good built quality , camera performance
-	The only 2 problems I found with this phone is that the screen contrast and brightness is poor .  The other is that the software could be better like multi window should support instant messaging and the camera needs more modes .  Battery is impressive Im on lollipop

-	I have the LG G3  ( F400S )  .  Out of the box ,  there is no sound from the loudspeaker at all .  My laptop and PC do not recognise the phone  ( all drivers from LG ,  PC Suite installed )  and the USB OTG does not work . 
-	Given that this is a superphone but wondering why battery drains so fast that it won't last a day .  Just a moderate user for gaming and surfing plus texting and playing music because I want to save my battery life after I'm out from work but I'm still disappointed coz even on a stand-by time ,  it does consume more power .  Just want to know if some of you here guys are experiencing the same issue on lollipop version .  I don't know if it due to OS update since lollipop is unstable or is it the battery the common problem on this phone  ?    
-	I have the Lg3 my battery for not hold a charge at all and it glitches out and I always get missed calls but will get a voicemail  ,  does anybody have these problems  ?      ?      ?

-	hi ,  i having major problems in lg g3 gold 32gb v20u during music play using headphone .  It produce hissing sound in left ear channel .   I have high expectation on this phone but due to audio problems ,  it's turn me off
-	I updated my G3 on the 5th of November and since then I have been having problems with my phone .  The battery runs out rapidly when the phone is on standby .  I cannot open any apps because it just freezes and my phone won't let me send any text messages .  I have tried to factory reset it in the setting and the phone doesn't respond to that .  When I turn it off and try the other factory reset way the by hold the down and off button ,  the phone doesn't respond to that either .  I have messaged LG about the problem and they have not come up with a solution .  Does any one have some advise for me  ?    
-	The battery backup of G3 is worst .  Do not listen to others .  Just buy Samsung S5 or note 4 and enjoy . 
-	Battery backup of G3 is worst .  Better buy S5 ,  Note 3 N9005 or note4 . 
-	I had my first LGG3 replaced under warranty .  Second LGG3 is horrible ,  is thinks it's on headphones btw which I have never used .  When talking to people via phone call it goes into headphone mode and ppl hang up on me .  I call them back and ask why now have learned to put it on speaker or else people can't hear me talking to them .  Piece of crap . 
-	90 out of 100 for its usage .  It is because it has 3gb Ram as its specification says .  But it gets heated up so quickly specially when its camera is used .  I can not make video shots with it .  it gets hang up or switched off while camera in use .  Secondly it gets heated up while a game is being played ,  not only heating up ,  horribly extreme level of heat has been noticed .  Examined up to 53 degree . 
- 	It lasted 2-3 hours for a full charge .  I've done factory restresetting the phone couple of times .  But nothing changed .  I'm very much in problem .  What should I do  ?      ?     Can anyone help me please  ?      ?     I'm using D-855 16gb model .  Thanks in advance . 
-	I have this phone for few months ,  3gb version ,  I honestly think that the lollipop is the issue ,  phone is too laggy for it's specs ,  battery is poor ,  and it heats even on 10min surfing .  My previous phone was lg g2 32gb ,  had no problems ,  even faster than my g3 .  Give us update Lg  ! 
-	This phone drains your battery if you use brightness above 50% .  Also the stanby time is bad I lose 5% every 3hours
- 	the battery is just average .  About the overheating ,  it happen once a month back where the phone was heating up for no reason , l had to turn it off to stop the heating .  It does not happen often or if you play heavy games
-	Don’t buy G3
-	My LG G3 got restart again and again after sim insert
-	g3 specs but listen heating or battery drain fast issues on internet
-	This phone heats up a lot .  The battery is good but I keep getting ads popping up in my play store and I dont have any different apps than before .  I've had to wipe to new 2-3 times because of this .  It's annoying as well as user ability .  It freezes and shuts down .  The loading time for the apps is terrible even if I have full service /  full Wi-Fi connection .  I usually have to reboot and try again .  It's just a huge neussence .  I give it 2 stars .  One star for the battery and another star for the camera . 
-	I have the same issue .  It will be great if LG fix that problem .  I don't touch my phone ,  and problem is heating and battery draining to fast . 
-	Hello .  Everybody have a problem in Lg g3 since uptadet in lolipop .  i have also lg g3 and i love it .  I have kittkat verzion .  More little time ,  we will have the last softer 6 . 0 and then no more problem im sure in that . 
-	i have the 32GB / 3G ram verizon model and after i updated to lollipop the phone consumes too much battery while the mobile data is on  .  . even if the phone screen is turned off and put in my pocket .  .  .  .  and it heats so bad even though while I'm not using it  .  does anyone have this issue or its just my phone  ?    
-	I am not going to say LG G3 on screen time is really great with the QHD display to support : )  .  .  but the stand by time is pretty stable .  
-	I first got my LG g3 less than a month ago .  I was charging it overnight one night and while on the charger my phone died .  I don't often charge my phone overnight because I keep hearing about how bad that is for the battery but it was the only time in my day that I could charge it .  After this my phone refused to charge for a few days no matter which combonation of 3 bricks  ( usb to wall plug )  and 3 cords from older phones we used .  A few days later we took the dead phone to a warrenty center to have it checked and they said it was a problem with the phone itself .  So I got a new phone from them ad today it is having a similar problem !  so frustrating !  now going to get my 3rd copy .  .  lets see if this one will hold a charge .  . 
-	battery back up is too poor . If you use the phone for 10 minutes , it looses 6-8% charge . With this type of bettery back up , this is really a shit . 
-	So disappointing that Lg made such a disgrace to a great phone
-	I hate it's over heating issue as I am unable to use this phone just bcz it gets heat up soon  .  Thank god I have spare phone as I can't be dependent on this phone any more .  .  not worth buying .  .  .  better option in this price range . 
-	I only have 3 issues with this phone .  I don't receive push notifications on mobile data ,  the phone overheats when playing heavy games for 5mins and the battery drains ridiculously fast on stanby or playing any game .  I hope that this is a lollipop bug but Im sure the overheating cant be solved . 
-	sometimes it heats up immensely and battrey drains so fast .  The problem doesn't solve until plugged in
-	LG made a big flop with this .  I don't think any update can fix the battery problem here .  And why does it over heat  ?     the oppo find 7 dosnt heat up either .  Makes you wonder if LG made this fone over a weekend . 
-	i am not satisfied with this phone .  my phone is LG G3 3GB but aps is too lagging ,  android dailer make more heat .  touch screen not good . 
-	Lg g3 best position kit Kat version downloading is great and work is well lollipop versions downloading is too slow i have both versions 95 , 55 . s
-	Not happy as it continues to shutdown without any known reason .  If anyone can help me with a solution ,  I would be too grateful to them .  
-	I returned this phone within two days .  Lot of bugs ,  battery sucks ,  bad touch sense ,  very hot even in normal browsing ,  very less features ,  no difference between 2k and 1k screen resolution ,  average camera quality ,  etc .  But ear phone sound quality was good . 
-	DON'T BUY MOBILE PHONE IN AMAZON .  I PURCHASED THIS PHONE ,  HE WILL PROVIDE ME USED PHONE ,  LIKE VERY CHEAP . AND ACCESSORIES PROVIDE DIFFERENT PHONE AND CHEAP QUALITY .  I AM FACING A LOT OF PROBLEM .  AND I HAVE COURIER THIS PHONE
-	I have been using this phone for 8 months .  .  .  . so far average but now started restarting 4 to 5 times daily even though I am using this with extra care .  I would definitely not recommend this phone from LG . 
-	The phone should be avoided .  .  .  Its battery died before 10 months and new battery is also having problem .  The sound is not upto the mark .  Its music player starts on its own .  Plz avoid . 
-	Phone seems to get overheated many times . 
-	Got this product yesterday . All i can say everything is good like camera scren quality . But the battery back up sucks . It lasted for 2 . 5hr only and it get super hot when u play video over wifi . Just want say if u need good battery back dnt go for this . 
-	Voice quality is not good . 
-	Phone keeps restarting itself after updating to Lollipop .  Many has the same problem .  never buy LG mobiles . 
-	the battery drains very quickly due to high screen resolution .  Moreover we cannot differentiate any high quality in this screen with our eyes . 
-	It is the worst phone  . I just hate it  . It has so many features but no battery backup . What is the use of having so many features but no battery back up . I regret for taking this phone . Please dont prefer this phone If you prefer you have to regret later on . This is out of my experience . Thank you
-	The device began to hang within a week .  .  .  The touch screen doesn't respond at times .  .  .  Camera quality not as great as advertised .  .  .  3GB ram not of much use as games tend to crash the device .  .  .  Alot of lag with the UI
-	The product is not worth the money .  There are so many issues with this phone .  Frequent restarts ,  apps stop working ,  phone gets hanging ,  the phone gets heated all of a sudden and needed to take out and put the battery in to solve all these issues .  This is happening periodically . I would suggest to invest the money in a branded phones like iPhone or HTC .  No LG phones please !  ! 
-	Poor battery performance . Heats like hell while playing games . Not got what was promised by seller ( Rainbow )  . Amazon also not responding to mails . 
-	After using the LG L90 for a year I had become a fan of the LG product and decided to go for the LG G3 even though LG G4 had launched because the SAR value of the G3 was very low .  After using for a few days found that the phone lags ,  overheats ,  and battery drains out with very nominal usage of feww calls and messages ,  ,  ,  ,  ( i hardly use internet thru out the day  )   ,  maybe max 1 hr a day ,  ,  ,  ,  and no movies or music is played  ,  still battery has to be charged twice a day atleast . Extremely unhappy with my LG phone ,  will never buy a LG phone again . 
-	Bought the Phone in December'14 ,  within two months the phone display broken which fell from considerably small height .  As mentioned in the Box One time Free screen replacement is there .  As i immediately approached LG customer care ,  they straight away refused that for physical damage it will not be covered under free replacement .  Dont understand how else can a mobile screen be damaged and on what basis the free replacement will be done .  Again i started approaching LG now ,  they are mentioning that free replacement is valid for six months only .  adding to that now the customer care representative is mentioning that there free replacement is possible for physical damage and records are there for my earlier complaint but nothing cant be done now
-	The looks of phone are really great and that is the only reason for me to take this phone but guys this phone really not worth paying this much amount .  It has got serious heating problem .  Remaining everything is good but the battery drains out very fast after catching the heat .  If you are opting for thus phone think multiple times and be ready to face the problem
-	I'm wondering if the mobile phone or the battery is defective here .  Phone does not charge upto 100% battery even after charging for 13 hours straight !  And once operational ,  battery discharges within 4 to 5 hours of basic operation . 
-	Not so worthy .  .  .  Nexus is better
-	The product details does not mention RAM or what version of Android it runs
-	Again LG failed to build a Lag free ROM  .  It’s the worst comparatively Samsung  &  Sony Phone  .  The HTC sense OS are very responsive and LAG free  .  I like HTC sense among all android Manufacturers
-	QHD eating Battery ,  every single minute the battery percentage is getting down  .  This is the worst I have noticed  .  However the Backup of this phone is nearby or Slightly better than M7 Only .  Rest Note 2  ,  3  ,  S5  ,  Z3  ,  M8 have better battery life
-	The inbuilt IR blaster is too weak comparatively M7 , M8  &  S5 … Even from an Inch the device is not getting controlled
-	Pre-Installed Unnecessary Apps 
-	Heat Issue  (  Biggest Concern for LG  )  near to camera on a minimum usage  (  Facebook ,  Whatsapp  &  twitter  )  of the device
-	There is so much of lagging on the arrival day itself .  .  Not satisfied . 
-	After using the phone when in standby mode the phone heats and battery drains fastly actually with the QHD DISPLAY screen consume much battery then other excellent phone with poor battery
-	heating issues even for calls .  . quad hd not upto mark  .  low contrast .  . not worth for 35000
-	Low battery life on decent usage .  .  Excellent camera .  And smooth flow .  . 
-	automatically shut down many times while bettry is full
-	this phone has overheating Issues . 
-	Seriously ,  there is no point to have awesome features when you cannot use them .  No matter how much I try ,  battery drains super fast . I always keep my brightness low and try to minimize usage of heavy battery consumption applications as much as possible .  Still the phone would consume the battery quickly . 
-	Negative part of the phone is the handset gets hot even after 1 call .  It is impossible to talk for more than 5-7 Mins as it gets so heated up that you start feeling burning sensation on your ears . 
-	Audio is not good
-	This phone has heating and hanging issues .  complained flipkart on this and they replaced with new one .  For my surprise the replacement phone also had same issue . When i complained on this again they offered to return my money . 
-	This phone is crazily overpriced for stupid reasons .  no finger print scanner , no waterproof rating ,  no super amoled screen ,  no heartrate scanner and photos not clear in dark too much picture noise . 
-	I bought LG G3 a few days back after using Galaxy S3 for many years which developed quite a bit of lag after updating OS to JB and also due to many Apps installed . Many good things are talked about this phone , which are true and I like them .  What I found which is not mentioned generally is that you cannot browse internet or use any App that needs data access while you are in a call .  I find this a serious disadvantage .  Even my old S3 supported this .  G3 being a new generation phone ,  I find this a serious flaw . 
-	The phone is getting hanged for minutes within 1 week
-	I didn't find any useful things in this phone .  .  .  . I can't even put my contact PIC in my phone and phone memory also very lose don't buy this phone .  .  .  .  . plz consider my request better to go another phones .  .  . 
-	Pretty bad .  Battery drainage is too high ,  doesn't last long .  Feels like ,  need to keep on charging the mobile .  Bad choice . 
-	Front Camera not good , it gives bad pixels . 
-	DISPALY IS NOT GOOD
-	Cool phone features ,  good display .  It is not better than Samsung at all though .  The overheating on this phone is AWFUL .  My fingers and hand were very hot from using it with the brightness all the way down and no apps running .  Good phone but it's not for me
-	Charger stopped working after a week cannot use universal microusb .  .  .  Pop up says  " charging stopped please use cord that came with the phone "  grrrr and verizon wont do anything cause i didnt buy from them
-	Just opened up and tried to activate and the SIM card wouldn't read .  Thought maybe the card had an issue ,  so I used another SIM card and still didn't work .  think the SIM card and SD card reader has an issue . 
-	Power button works intermittently ,  screen will shut off immediately after turning on ,  Google search pops up randomly ,  for zero reason ,  usually when listening to music .  GPS is literally useless anymore  ( Read as: it doesn't work ,  at all )  ,  touch screen has severe sensitivity issues ,  bloatware is ridiculous ,  and uses tons of background data ,  charging port is going out after 1 . 5 months of use ,  mini stereo jack is going out too .  I mean ,  the list goes on and on .  I have had these problems with every G3 that I've had . 
-	Screen cracked within a week of getting it .  Not even sure how .  Small crack causes entire screen not to work .  Had two LG G2 and same thing happened .  I will never purchase LG again . 
-	I am extremely disappointed .  My LG3 shuts down by itself and want turn on unless I plug it to the charger even if the battery is fully charged !  !  !  ! 
-	Phone screen and digitizer broke the first time I dropped it  ( landed flat ,  not even on a corner )  ,  also got really hot if used for more than 30 minutes
-	2 months ago ,  my phone got a dead spot directly across the center of the phone .  I did not drop it or anything to cause damage to cause this .  VERY dissatisfied .  I haven't even had it an entire year yet . 
-	It ok .  When you open the back it is very filty .  It is clutching when turning on or off and some days doesn't want to turn on . 
-	Worked great for less than a year .  Bought it in July 2015 ,  now screen no longer functioning as of end of February 2016 .  .  .  kind of a waste of money when I was attempting to save money by not having a contract with verizon .  .  . 
-	Bought from verizon store .  I liked everything about this phone but the battery burns out way too fast ,  which is a huge pet peeve for me .  Also ,  not a year after I bought this ,  it has stopped charging .  Big disappointment . 
-	Bought in August and the sim card reader no longer works .  It is only 6 months old .  Never dropped it .  It has always been in a protective case . 
-	Huge disappointment coming from a galaxy s4 .  I was told this would be on par with my year and a half year old phone but this simply is not true .  It has a significant limitation to multitasking and I find it continuously closing out applications on me  ( playing I heart radio while running the GPS often will close out of both )  while my old galaxy could do both of those and Facebook / email / etc .  Its a major step down and I will certainly be getting a galaxy again next .  The only good thing about this phone is I only have to have it for one year .  If this is your first smart phone you'll likely be Impressed ,  if you've used another high end smartphone you'll likely find this one underpowered
-	The worst phone ever had went through four of them in 2 weeks cause it would shut off on its own
-	DO NOT BUY THEIR USED / REFURBISHED PHONES !  !  I bought a phone and it died on me in a few months . 
-	Shipped with broken NFC connectors ,  refuses to make data connections at less than 5 bars . 
-	i hate this phone .  It sends messages to whoever you're texting like 8 times .  You have to hit the screen a bunch of times to unlock it .  I wish I never got it .  Can't wait until income tax to get rid of it ! 
-	I have had it less than a month ,  dropped it once and it's shattered . 
-	After about 2 months the phone began connecting / disconnecting to my wireless connection .  By this I mean every few seconds .  It literally did it dozens of times while I was on hold waiting for technical support .  They were unable to help correct the problem and eventually had me reset the phone to factory specs .  Of course that didn't work and I had to get a warranty replacement . 
-	had 2-3 issues wrong right out of the box .  decided to return it . 
-	Badly scrached on screen and back .  Runs fine so far . 
-	The phone isn't that great .  Had it for a couple days and it started to turn off on its own .  Wouldn't purchase stay away
-	Terrible stock rom Speakerphone issues ,  not loud enough ,  would drop calls when switching between speakerphone and non-speakerphone . Microphone easily by many different cases ,  had to try several different ones and it's still messed . Battery lasts less than one day with normal use .  This phone is terrible .  Will never buy from LG again . 
-	Disappointed .  I have this phone for 6 months .  Battery life is poor likely due to screen being a battery hog .  Ultra HD screen is a gimmick  ;  inconsequential for a human eye .  Screen brightness in outdoor situation is an issue .  Screen freezes once in a while and transition between screens is not smooth . 
-	Lasted 5 hours .  Died shortly after .  I mean ,  died ,  as in it became unresponsive and would not react to a new battery or being charged .  I took it to the Verizon store ,  and they said it was defective .  So ,  something went wrong ,  just not sure what . 
-	Not happy with devices sent ,  when you buy 2 ,  and only one works .  Shame it only lets me give one star .  Stay with HTC .  And maybe eBay . 
-	Had to send back 2x through Amazon for defective hardware .  They even charged me a restocking fee once I told them I gave up and was scared that they would send me another defective piece of equipment . 
-	plastic back gave for a bad feeling build quality .  I didn't drop it because as soon as I used it a little I realized I would be returning it so I couldn't test it . screen lag doing anything , turning the screen on ,  camera shudder opening an app  ( ANY app )  color on the screen were not vibrant .  yeah it has a big screen and gets real bright but the colors were not vibrant . x1000 battery life .  had battery life of the first gen 4g phones .  like ,  I'd take it off the charger and it predicted it had 8 hours of battery life without opening any apps ,  from a fresh start
-	The lg g3 is the worse phone .  In less than 3 months ,  the does not take a charge ,  no calls are even able to come through  ,  all calls go straight to voicemail .  I have it with sprint and they already replaced the first g3 that didnt work ,  now the second phone started doing the same thing .  They offered to replace it again and at this point i wouldn't take this phone if they paid me . 
-	Overall great phone ,  until you realize that lg has sub-par manufacturing .  My phone developed a crack on the mic ,  this phone is perfect .  Amazing how both LG and AT & T know nothing about this ,  even when other carriers are replacing handsets . If you decide to get this phone and go with AT & T ,  get the warranty and get ready to explain and prove that it was not you that caused these cracks . 
-	The phone was rooted  ( I don't know what that is )  and I was unable to update the operating system .  I returned it .  I wanted an unlocked phone without all the bloat-ware that AT & T puts on their version of the phones .  I will wait for the new Google Nexus 5 2015 to come out this Oct or Nov .  and purchase that . 
-	Arrived defective .  Flickering screen .  Same issue I've read in other complaints .  Returned .  Oh well .  Shipping was swift though ,  and well packaged .  Pity about the product . 
-	I have no idea how this phone has any positive reviews .  I suppose it was a decent phone for the first week I owned it .  I've had it a year now and everyday I grow to hate it more .  It's not all bad though ,  sometimes this phone is so terrible that I actually laugh a little ,  then I think about how good the marketing staff at LG is ,  cause they got me to pay $350 for a piece of plastic that lights up when the battery isn't dead . 
-	locked up after three months - worst phone I have ever owned
-	Will not let me get into play store .  Send it back . 
-	The phone itself is very slippery .  Face up / face down it's simply hard to grab .  Without a case I was always on the verge of dropping it .  When it was face down on a slightly slanted surface it would slowly slide allllllll the way down til it fell off .  You MUST get a case with this phone if you don't want to be dropping it every time you attempt to pick it up . 
-	About 50% of the time people have trouble hearing me when we are talking on the phone .  If I hang up and call them back it's fine .  For some reason the mic on the phone is very nilly willy .  Sometimes it works ,  sometimes it doesn't .  I shouldn't have to hang up mid convo half the time .  Rather obnoxious . 
-	The phone is SLOW as ever .  Whether I am trying to unlock the phone  ( I use the knock code )  ,  switch between apps ,  or simply trying to text ,  this phone cannot keep up .  More often than not I have to put my knock code at least twice before the phone recognizes it .  Not that I am typing it in wrong either ,  the phone just doesn't register .  When switching between apps I have to push the back button OVER AND OVER AND OVER just to get out of the current app .  
-	There was no armour protection at all .  Dropped phone it broke . 
-	Phone sucks ! 
-	Garbage .  Cheapo dispos-a-phones work better than this flushable dumb phone .  From the dim display to the useless controls that defy common sense to the bitter end .  What a treat it is to call an automated phone system with a phone that has a vanishing keypad which ends the call like magic should the wrong button be pushed .  there's only 3 of 'em Vol up / down and on / off THAT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT decide to begin a photo essay of your new anger management methods .  Grand Canyon Frisbee comes to mind each time I think of LG G3 phones amazing sucking farts from dead chickens feature .  Both add up to the same result .  LG+G3 0 = { }
-	Too small compared to my Galaxy Note 2 .  I wanted a big phone not a smaller one . 
-	I hate this phone .  I will definitely go back to my Apple product . 
-	Defective Hardware .  It has a 4k res camera ,  but whenever you use it ,  you have a 10% chance that you will not be able to record audio . it glitches like crazy whenever I try to use my 4k camera feature ,  and this glitch is made even worse ,  and more apparent whenever you zoom in . I returned my first phone ,  and had a replacement sent to me .  But it is obvious that it is a major design defect ,  because both phones have the same problem .  I do not know if this affect will happen with 2k ,  or with any other function ,  but I do know that it is very disappointing to pay $600 for something that is supposed to be  " top of the line "  . 
-	Junk .  I've had this phone for a week now and have had nothing but problems . Battery: The battery life is very disappointing .  It takes about about 6 hours to charge and lasts about 1-2 hours of on and off use .  Overheating: No matter what you are doing on the phone ,  it will get very hot .  It gets to the point where i have to set it down due to the uncomfort of the heat .  Connectivity: Everyone in my family switched to Sprint and we all got different phones .  I was the only one who got the G3 and am regretting it .  Everyone gets great service whereas i can barely connect to even wifi .  Cheaply made: This phone is made very poor .  It is slippery due to the plastic body .  The camera shatterd while in my pocket for no apparent reason . I would never recommend this piece of junk to anyone . 
-	I have a BB Torch 9850 ,  great phone ,  easy to use ,  instructions in plain English .  I decided to move up to LTE because it claims to be faster ,  BULL .  I got an LG G3 .  I like the screen ,  that's all .  My old Blackberry 9850 is just as fast with 3G .  LG came with limited instructions and no in phone user directions like the Blackberry .  Im going back to Blackberry where they use plain English to help you .  For instance ,  my Blackberry came without a manual ,  in two weeks I was operating it like a pro .  not with the LG G3 .  Overated crap . 
-	Both phones broke within a week piece of trash
-	Very disappointed  ,  the cellphone is cracked on the bottom and I feel that I just wasted my money because at anytime that crack will damage the screen  ,  and the charger doesn't not work AT ALL ,  I know that buying used isn't always good but gezzzz this was the worst and I will not be recommending or buying from this vendor ever ,  I did not ask for a return becAuse I need the phone like crazy  , and because I was just replacing my brand new one I just used charger from it and keep the phone away from falling because I know that very soon I will have to replace it
-	Snappy processor but screen was washed out and had color banding issues  ,  returned for refund
-	Whether you get this phone on contract or pay $600 for it ,  it will be loaded with spyware and bloatware .  I'm sure these companies get kickbacks for installing all this garbage .  It's a violation of my privacy and personal property .  As a tech geek it takes all the fun out of owning anything .  Why don't I take my business elsewhere  ?     It would mean being without a computer ,  phone and contact with the outside world .  Every one of these companies feels entitled to charge you $600 ,  waste space on your phone with uninstallable garbage apps ,  endanger your security and pass your data out to practically anybody .  I disabled about 20 apps and will probably have to root my phone .  You shouldn't have to pay a cent for this phone .  They should be paying you . 
-	The phone is nice and all .  But i'm having major problems with the phone's bluetooth and car bluetooth .  My 2014 lexus E350 and the lg G3 phone are apparently not compatible .  The connect is unstable .  Therefore I have to buy a new phone .  So my recommendation is if you have a lexus don't get the LG G3 or vise versa . 
-	Worked just fine for a few months but after a software patch the phone went into a rolling reboot . Now I have to mail it to LG for repair and will be with out a phone until its returned to me . I should of just bought another Iphone .  Finally got a replacement after 10 days and it worked ok for over a year but today it died .  Now I have the blue screen of death .  Looks like I am phone shopping today and will never buy a LG again .  I am hearing there new phones and not any better . 
-	this phone on sprint did nothing but drop data i was very upset that sprint would send this phone out like that
-	This is the worst phone I've ever purchased !  I bought this phone for T-Mobile with insurance .  The next day I bought it I had to return it because the battery went from 100% to 0% within 5 hours .  They gave me another new phone ,  same issue except the second phone doesn't die as fast as the one i had before .  Everything about this phone is great but the battery life completely sucks .  Never again I'm buying this ! 
-	Quad HD  ?     2560 x 1440  ?     What LG  ?      ?     Quad HD means 4 times as many pixels as HD resolution offers . World Full HD standard: 1920 x 1080 = 2 . 07 MpixelWorld Quad HD resolution standard: 3840 x 2160 = 8 . 3 Mpixel  ( 2 . 07Mpixel x 4 )  .  LG  " QUAD "  resolutuion: 2560 x 1440 = 3 . 68 Mpixel  ( 2 . 07Mpixel x 1 . 7 )  How is this a Quad HD  ?      ?      ?     LG is obviously thinking that all their consumer is so stupid .  Maybe they are right .  I would never buy a phone from the company that makes such ridiculous false statements right on a box . 
-	Bought this phone and it is great except that the microphone has issues .  It keeps cutting in and out .  People say I sound like I'm very far away or underwater .  I replaced the first and the second has the same problem .  It is definitely not the way I'm holding it or the case .  I will trade it in for something else . 
-	The input for the charger broke after only 2 months so now it can't be charged . 
-	This phone is horrible !  I would not recommend it to anyone .  It was time for an upgrade so I went and checked out phones at the Sprint store .  This seemed to be intuitive and easy to use and have a good camera .  The problem is our it's noted user friendly our nearly as easy my Samsung Galaxy 3 was .  Nothing but issues .  Now I'm either stuck with this piece of junk or I have to pay full price for the phone I want .  Do yourself a favor and get a Galaxy 5 .  You'll be much happier . 
-	I had a terrible experience with this phone .  I purchased mine at Best Buy instead of Amazon .  I was shocked by the glowing reviews on Amazon ,  so I had to put in my 2 cents .  My original G3 had a wonky micro-USB port .  You had to tilt and wiggle the plug just to get it in .  It was an annoying struggle .  The phone was also prone to random reboots and at times would start inputting numbers instead of letters when I pushed the letter keys on the LG keyboard .  
-	Bad phone
-	it didn't even turn on next day
-	I would recommend the phone but DON'T BUY IT FROM SPRINT .  They are the worse wireless company in the world .  You would buy a awesome phone but recieve the worse customer service in the world . 
-	Didn't buy here on Amazon still wanted to review though first it dims all the time slow and pauses all the time when I am typing planning to return and get Samsung 5 just really was not feeling from day 1 star because won't let post without hate I chose this phone
-	First day while waiting for my case thru amazon if fell off my chair unto a area rug it's in pieces all over the screen would not even start up .  I was with AT & T with insurance of course not covered
-	About a month ago I got pissed cuz I could not see something on my iphone 5 .  So I went and bought Samsung GALAXYS5 buggy software I took it back .  Got the LG3 and same thing buggy software ,  Must be an Android thing .  .  .  Now I'm selling the LG3 and WAITING for the new iPhones .  . 
-	give this phone 1 star .  First and foremost the LG G3 has to be a phone .  The G3 must be able to connect to the AT & T network for data and GSM for phone calls . 
-	I bought an LG G3 .  The charging port on it didn't work properly .  Any charging cable I used needed to be wiggled around and held in a certain position before it would charge properly .  I reported this to Verizon and they gave me the runaround .  The phone ended up bursting into flames  ( actually lots and lots of smoke )  and finally Verizon decided to take notice .  After seeing all the scorching on the phone they said for the low low cost of 8 . 99 I can have the phone replaced .  .  .  they acknowledged it was a manufacturer defect over and over again and still made me pay to have it replaced !  !  !  !  The best part ,  when the phone phone came it it has the same problems as the old phone .  Charging port doesn't work and I found out the replaced it with a refurbished phone that doesn't quite work right . 
-	I just lowered the stars from 4 down to 1 ,  so people will read this review and reconsider purchasing a G3 .  I have a more aggravating problem with this phone .  Whenever the phone switches from 4G to 3G ,  the battery starts to drop FAST and the phone gets uncomfortably hot .  It happens EVERY TIME I am in a 3G area .  The only way I have found to stop the battery drain and heat ,  is to turn off Mobile Data .  I can still send and receive calls ,  but no apps or Internet Access .  I like everything else about this phone ,  but if you are on the fence between this phone and Samsung G6 ,  go with the G6 .  My daughter has one and has no issues . 
-	Vibrates on and off for 10 minutes after fully charged ,  which is normally in the middle of the night .  To combat this I have to set the vibration to the lowest setting and make sure the phone is on carpet when charging .  I do not particularly like this  " power saving "  feature .  I contacted LG and they are  " working on it ,  "   " googles fault ,  "  and that there is  " nothing they can do .  "  On top of not taking responsibility the customer service rep came off as rude and could not care less about the problem .  How hard it it to write software to have the option to turn that off !  !  !  I took off 4 stars because I value my sleep .  I went to two Verizon stores and they both said call LG and that they have received similar complaints . 
-	After 16 months with my phone ,  which I purchased brand new on Amazon ,  the screen faded to black from the corners and subsequently turned off .  The haptic feedback and LED light indicated that the phone was still working ,  so I am assuming the LCD panel was bad .  Subsequently ,  the screen only flickered on occasionally ,  going dark within seconds
-	My Lg G3 phone had the overheat issue and I got 80+ ( C )  degree on the CPU from my two week experience .  This is not the normal temperature for a smartphone .  Once the phone got too warm  ( hot )  ,  the screen started lagging and the battery got drained fast .  I had to return this phone .  Honestly i love this phone with all the new features ,  but the lags and battery life when it gets too warm stopped me from keeping it . 
-	Battery life is very short ,  there are days I find my phone is down to 60% or less by lunch time even though I haven't touched my phone all day .  I have to carry a charged spare battery just to ensure I have phone service all day . 
-	This phone was great for the first few months .  Then it went downhill .  The phone would overheat constantly ,  especially on the back near the power and volume button .  On the front of the screen ,  the bottom half would be cool ,  but the top half would be hot to touch .  The screen and operating system interface were extremely laggy almost to the point of needing rebooted every day .  For the last 6 months or so ,  I've dealt with a screen that was dim 90% of the time .  It might have gone to full brightness for a few seconds ,  but quickly back to dim .  Just recently my phone died a glorious death ,  overheating ,  freezing ,  and then the screen would fade slowly to black ,  then flash nonstop ,  then do nothing for 30 minutes .  It's been a day ,  and the longest I've been able to do anything was a stretch of about 15 seconds where I was able to text wife ,   " Phone died .  "  I would not recommend this phone . 
-	Terrible - turns on at random moments and it is supposed to be a  " feature "  . 
-	The battery life is horrible ,  it overheats ,  it feels cheap and its slow .  My previous phone was the Galaxy s3 and I loved it .  I had high hopes with this phone as a replacement ,  larger screen ,  higher resolution ,  great camera .  .  but it's been a huge disappointment .  The camera is great ,  but everything else is lacking .  I'm a big fan of the LG brand in general ,  but I'll never buy another one of their phones again . 
-	I have some issue with the camera not being focus correctly and the pattern login didn't activate even though I turned the feature on .  Sometimes is on and sometimes is not .  I'm returning this LG G3 phone and should look for Samsung Note 4 instead .  I expected this LG phone should be the cutting edge ,  unfortunately ,  not in this case . 
-	I was so excited for this phone but .  .  It was good for 3 months it's slowly getting worst I've been having this problems saying when I go online  " cannot connect to proxy server "  now I've never had this with any other phone and it's upsetting me .  I got this from Sprint and it's terrible this phone is messed up from the inside happiness for this phone dissapared . 
-	I bought the LG G3 in October of 2014 - the mic has already gone out .  Can only speak to callers through bluetooth or speaker .  The phone is extremely slow and I'm only using less than half of total space  ( should not be this slow )  and lately it freezes up and the only way to get is back in  " working order "  is to pop the battery .  So ,  this has been the most frustrating phone I've owned .  Based on other reviews I can only assume I got a lemon . 
-	Overheats .  I loved my G2 so bought a G3 .  Mistake .  The phone overheats really quickly and when it does it throttles performance .  It will start lagging and all sorts of not so nice stuff .  Camera is great as always and battery life was decent but nowhere near G2 levels .  I really wanted to like this phone but ended up sending it back . 
-	This phone is okay .  It has trouble staying connected to Wifi .  It also has an issue where the phone will randomly shut down apps while you're using them .  Searching the forums ,  this is a known issue that can sometimes be fixed with a software reset .  I did this ,  and within the first day it shut down Pandora again . 
-	This is definitely the WORST cellphone I've owned .  The battery drain is horrendous ,  and call reception is poor .  Please note that I'm using the same Provider ,  in the same rooms / buildings /  areas as before ,  and not a huge data user .  I went for the BIG screen--HUGE mistake .  And 20 months left on the Contract . 
-	Ran sluggish when we purchased it .  Granted I had a Nexus 5 that didn't have all the manufacturer garbage apps on it .  I did like the camera and the focus on it - it could focus on near and far in the same photo .  We returned . 
-	I just didn't care for it ,  don't really know why the battery run down kind of fast but it probably was my apps and how I was using it .  went to a droid turbo and like it
-	This phone broke after I had it 7 months or so .  Despite Sprint and LG admitting it was a warranty issue ,  neither LG or Sprint would repair it . 
-	Excellent hardware specs ,  poor durability .  Dropped it from 2 feet and the screen shattered .  Really ,  it shattered .  Completely unusable . 
-	The pattern was spliced all the way across the cover adv bout an inch from the top of the phone . 
-	Terrible autocorrect .  I've tried the LG keyboard and 9 other Android keyboards ;  and none come close to the intelligence of the iPhone .  How can LG issue a phone that cannot even put an apostrophe in words like  " didn't "  ,   " I'm "  ,   " it's "  ,   " hasn't "   ?      ?     I thought with time that the phone would quickly learn the right words ;  two months later ,  that hasn't happened . No mute button on the exterior of the phone . 
-	Defective phone !  The audio Jack icon kept appearing and volumen could NOT BE HEARD ! 
-	Burn screen p they offer my money back but i keep the phone anyway good phone
-	Great phone ,  but it's not unlocked .  I bought it before shipping out to an overseas posting ,  only to find that the local SIM wouldn't work without an unlock code .  It is taking long ,  complicated ,  frustrating calls with AT & T to get this worked out . 
-	After 1 week ,  phone randomly reboots .  Hard reset 3 times .  Disabled several Google apps ,  Verizon and Lg bloatware .  Hoping this solves problem or phone is going back .  Disappointed Lg doesn't hasn't updated to kit Kat 4 . 4 . 4 .  Wife has Motorola phone that gets latest updates quickly .  Lg better hire more software engineers if it wants to compete in very competitive cell phone market .  .  . 
-	Has glitches .  Such as shutting off randomly  &  unlocking / locking randomly .  Will turn some features randomly by itself .  Battery life is efficient however .   &  can be fast when it wants . 
-	The screen broke with one drop while in a case .  A co-worker had the same issue with it .  The gorilla glass is not that strong .  Other than that ,  a good phone . 
-	good for money but messes up with hangouts android . 
-	Used it as main line phone for a month ,  didn't like it at all .  .  . now is my second line ,  hardly used . 
-	The battery stopped working after the first time used
-	Poor battery life ,  low quality of photo ,  cannot even store picture time stamp in the phone right ,  the time stamp is always wrong .  I switched from iPhone 4s to this one ,  thought just read the online document ,  it would be not big deal for either iPhone or Android phone .  Oh ,  yes ,  the photos I removed from the phone would come back on the second day or two ,  pretty annoying .  right now it worth only one cent ,  you would waste more money in a long run .  what a joke ! 
-	It's a piece of shit . if I cover up the camera and try to turn it on it'll flash on and off and it won't turn on in the dark it spazes out  .  .  . I've had it for about a week and a half ya it has its perks but it's still not a very good phone
-	I was hoping that it would be better than the Galaxy S3 I had previously had .  It's a big dissapointment .  for instance I miss the ease of txting on the galaxy and certain apps will not down load to the LG3 like Credit Karma .  I was hoping for an upgrade and recieved a down grade in my eyes .  Even the camera is not as good as I hoped . 
-	I tried the phone at the at & t store and was surprised by all the positive reviews about the screen .  It's the worest among all the phones that I had ,  and I had many ,  including the LG G pro and HTC One M8 . Specification wise is a great pone ,  but in reality ,  a bad overpriced phone . 
-	The phone seems to be immature and needs to focus more on its shortcuts and user friendliness .  Seems like um always pressing the back button and the exterior of the phone is so darn slippery And can't hardly keep it in my hands while texting ,  I mean it has great graphics and beautiful display but the texting is all over the place with adding punctuation where I don't want it and not spacing words unless hitting spacebar twice . 
-	The battery dies out quickly too .  However ,  I am sure that is my fault because I have so many messenger apps and my screen is always at 100% brightness . 
-	Cumbersome volume and power buttons on back of phone .  I will never buy another handset with buttons on the back .  Related to the point before ,  it is very difficult to do a screenshot  ( pressing volume down and power button at same time )  . No missed call or message notifications stay on the screen when the phone is locked . 
-	First issue that started to occur was it's inability to turn the screen back on during a phone call .  Now I must wait for the other person to hang up and if I get a voice mail I need to pull the battery .  Second problem occurred with the screen .  Somehow a white frost like ring has developed around the screen .  It becomes more serious with a lower brightness setting .  
-	When I linked Bluetooth to my car  ( latest Cadillac )  to listen music ,  the sound likes to be blocked ,  blurred and volume is very small ,  I have to turn volume to maximum .  I tried with different music players ,  all are same effect .  I speculate it is LG's Bluetooth transmitter is with problem . 
-	overheats after over 7 min of use ,  overheating leads to lag / sluggish performance and plastic ,  cheap feel
