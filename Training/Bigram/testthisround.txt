- This phone is horrible ! I would not recommend it to anyone . It was time for an upgrade so I went and checked out phones at the Sprint store . This seemed to be intuitive and easy to use and have a good camera . The problem is our it's noted user friendly our nearly as easy my Samsung Galaxy 3 was . Nothing but issues . Now I'm either stuck with this piece of junk or I have to pay full price for the phone I want . Do yourself a favor and get a Galaxy 5 . You'll be much happier .
- I had a terrible experience with this phone . I purchased mine at Best Buy instead of Amazon . I was shocked by the glowing reviews on Amazon , so I had to put in my 2 cents . My original G3 had a wonky micro-USB port . You had to tilt and wiggle the plug just to get it in . It was an annoying struggle . The phone was also prone to random reboots and at times would start inputting numbers instead of letters when I pushed the letter keys on the LG keyboard .
- Bad phone
- it didn't even turn on next day
- I would recommend the phone but DON'T BUY IT FROM SPRINT . They are the worse wireless company in the world . You would buy a awesome phone but recieve the worse customer service in the world .
- Didn't buy here on Amazon still wanted to review though first it dims all the time slow and pauses all the time when I am typing planning to return and get Samsung 5 just really was not feeling from day 1 star because won't let post without hate I chose this phone
- First day while waiting for my case thru amazon if fell off my chair unto a area rug it's in pieces all over the screen would not even start up . I was with AT & T with insurance of course not covered
- About a month ago I got pissed cuz I could not see something on my iphone 5 . So I went and bought Samsung GALAXYS5 buggy software I took it back . Got the LG3 and same thing buggy software , Must be an Android thing . . . Now I'm selling the LG3 and WAITING for the new iPhones . .
- give this phone 1 star . First and foremost the LG G3 has to be a phone . The G3 must be able to connect to the AT & T network for data and GSM for phone calls .
- I bought an LG G3 . The charging port on it didn't work properly . Any charging cable I used needed to be wiggled around and held in a certain position before it would charge properly . I reported this to Verizon and they gave me the runaround . The phone ended up bursting into flames ( actually lots and lots of smoke ) and finally Verizon decided to take notice . After seeing all the scorching on the phone they said for the low low cost of 8 . 99 I can have the phone replaced . . . they acknowledged it was a manufacturer defect over and over again and still made me pay to have it replaced ! ! ! ! The best part , when the phone phone came it it has the same problems as the old phone . Charging port doesn't work and I found out the replaced it with a refurbished phone that doesn't quite work right .
- I just lowered the stars from 4 down to 1 , so people will read this review and reconsider purchasing a G3 . I have a more aggravating problem with this phone . Whenever the phone switches from 4G to 3G , the battery starts to drop FAST and the phone gets uncomfortably hot . It happens EVERY TIME I am in a 3G area . The only way I have found to stop the battery drain and heat , is to turn off Mobile Data . I can still send and receive calls , but no apps or Internet Access . I like everything else about this phone , but if you are on the fence between this phone and Samsung G6 , go with the G6 . My daughter has one and has no issues .
- Vibrates on and off for 10 minutes after fully charged , which is normally in the middle of the night . To combat this I have to set the vibration to the lowest setting and make sure the phone is on carpet when charging . I do not particularly like this " power saving " feature . I contacted LG and they are " working on it , " " googles fault , " and that there is " nothing they can do . " On top of not taking responsibility the customer service rep came off as rude and could not care less about the problem . How hard it it to write software to have the option to turn that off ! ! ! I took off 4 stars because I value my sleep . I went to two Verizon stores and they both said call LG and that they have received similar complaints .
- After 16 months with my phone , which I purchased brand new on Amazon , the screen faded to black from the corners and subsequently turned off . The haptic feedback and LED light indicated that the phone was still working , so I am assuming the LCD panel was bad . Subsequently , the screen only flickered on occasionally , going dark within seconds
- My Lg G3 phone had the overheat issue and I got 80+ ( C ) degree on the CPU from my two week experience . This is not the normal temperature for a smartphone . Once the phone got too warm ( hot ) , the screen started lagging and the battery got drained fast . I had to return this phone . Honestly i love this phone with all the new features , but the lags and battery life when it gets too warm stopped me from keeping it .
- Battery life is very short , there are days I find my phone is down to 60% or less by lunch time even though I haven't touched my phone all day . I have to carry a charged spare battery just to ensure I have phone service all day .
- This phone was great for the first few months . Then it went downhill . The phone would overheat constantly , especially on the back near the power and volume button . On the front of the screen , the bottom half would be cool , but the top half would be hot to touch . The screen and operating system interface were extremely laggy almost to the point of needing rebooted every day . For the last 6 months or so , I've dealt with a screen that was dim 90% of the time . It might have gone to full brightness for a few seconds , but quickly back to dim . Just recently my phone died a glorious death , overheating , freezing , and then the screen would fade slowly to black , then flash nonstop , then do nothing for 30 minutes . It's been a day , and the longest I've been able to do anything was a stretch of about 15 seconds where I was able to text wife , " Phone died . " I would not recommend this phone .
- Terrible- turns on at random moments and it is supposed to be a " feature " .
- The battery life is horrible , it overheats , it feels cheap and its slow . My previous phone was the Galaxy s3 and I loved it . I had high hopes with this phone as a replacement , larger screen , higher resolution , great camera . . but it's been a huge disappointment . The camera is great , but everything else is lacking . I'm a big fan of the LG brand in general , but I'll never buy another one of their phones again .
- I have some issue with the camera not being focus correctly and the pattern login didn't activate even though I turned the feature on . Sometimes is on and sometimes is not . I'm returning this LG G3 phone and should look for Samsung Note 4 instead . I expected this LG phone should be the cutting edge , unfortunately , not in this case .
- I was so excited for this phone but . . It was good for 3 months it's slowly getting worst I've been having this problems saying when I go online " cannot connect to proxy server " now I've never had this with any other phone and it's upsetting me . I got this from Sprint and it's terrible this phone is messed up from the inside happiness for this phone dissapared .
- I bought the LG G3 in October of 2014- the mic has already gone out . Can only speak to callers through bluetooth or speaker . The phone is extremely slow and I'm only using less than half of total space ( should not be this slow ) and lately it freezes up and the only way to get is back in " working order " is to pop the battery . So , this has been the most frustrating phone I've owned . Based on other reviews I can only assume I got a lemon .
- Overheats . I loved my G2 so bought a G3 . Mistake . The phone overheats really quickly and when it does it throttles performance . It will start lagging and all sorts of not so nice stuff . Camera is great as always and battery life was decent but nowhere near G2 levels . I really wanted to like this phone but ended up sending it back .
- This phone is okay . It has trouble staying connected to Wifi . It also has an issue where the phone will randomly shut down apps while you're using them . Searching the forums , this is a known issue that can sometimes be fixed with a software reset . I did this , and within the first day it shut down Pandora again .
- This is definitely the WORST cellphone I've owned . The battery drain is horrendous , and call reception is poor . Please note that I'm using the same Provider , in the same rooms / buildings / areas as before , and not a huge data user . I went for the BIG screen--HUGE mistake . And 20 months left on the Contract .
- Ran sluggish when we purchased it . Granted I had a Nexus 5 that didn't have all the manufacturer garbage apps on it . I did like the camera and the focus on it- it could focus on near and far in the same photo . We returned .
- I just didn't care for it , don't really know why the battery run down kind of fast but it probably was my apps and how I was using it . went to a droid turbo and like it
- This phone broke after I had it 7 months or so . Despite Sprint and LG admitting it was a warranty issue , neither LG or Sprint would repair it .
- Excellent hardware specs , poor durability . Dropped it from 2 feet and the screen shattered . Really , it shattered . Completely unusable .
- The pattern was spliced all the way across the cover adv bout an inch from the top of the phone .
- Terrible autocorrect . I've tried the LG keyboard and 9 other Android keyboards ; and none come close to the intelligence of the iPhone . How can LG issue a phone that cannot even put an apostrophe in words like " didn't " , " I'm " , " it's " , " hasn't " ? ? I thought with time that the phone would quickly learn the right words ; two months later , that hasn't happened . No mute button on the exterior of the phone .
- Defective phone ! The audio Jack icon kept appearing and volumen could NOT BE HEARD !
- Burn screen p they offer my money back but i keep the phone anyway good phone
- Great phone , but it's not unlocked . I bought it before shipping out to an overseas posting , only to find that the local SIM wouldn't work without an unlock code . It is taking long , complicated , frustrating calls with AT & T to get this worked out .
- After 1 week , phone randomly reboots . Hard reset 3 times . Disabled several Google apps , Verizon and Lg bloatware . Hoping this solves problem or phone is going back . Disappointed Lg doesn't hasn't updated to kit Kat 4 . 4 . 4 . Wife has Motorola phone that gets latest updates quickly . Lg better hire more software engineers if it wants to compete in very competitive cell phone market . . .
- Has glitches . Such as shutting off randomly & unlocking / locking randomly . Will turn some features randomly by itself . Battery life is efficient however . & can be fast when it wants .
- The screen broke with one drop while in a case . A co-worker had the same issue with it . The gorilla glass is not that strong . Other than that , a good phone .
- good for money but messes up with hangouts android .
- Used it as main line phone for a month , didn't like it at all . . . now is my second line , hardly used .
- The battery stopped working after the first time used
- Poor battery life , low quality of photo , cannot even store picture time stamp in the phone right , the time stamp is always wrong . I switched from iPhone 4s to this one , thought just read the online document , it would be not big deal for either iPhone or Android phone . Oh , yes , the photos I removed from the phone would come back on the second day or two , pretty annoying . right now it worth only one cent , you would waste more money in a long run . what a joke !
- It's a piece of shit . if I cover up the camera and try to turn it on it'll flash on and off and it won't turn on in the dark it spazes out . . . I've had it for about a week and a half ya it has its perks but it's still not a very good phone
- I was hoping that it would be better than the Galaxy S3 I had previously had . It's a big dissapointment . for instance I miss the ease of txting on the galaxy and certain apps will not down load to the LG3 like Credit Karma . I was hoping for an upgrade and recieved a down grade in my eyes . Even the camera is not as good as I hoped .
- I tried the phone at the at & t store and was surprised by all the positive reviews about the screen . It's the worest among all the phones that I had , and I had many , including the LG G pro and HTC One M8 . Specification wise is a great pone , but in reality , a bad overpriced phone .
- The phone seems to be immature and needs to focus more on its shortcuts and user friendliness . Seems like um always pressing the back button and the exterior of the phone is so darn slippery And can't hardly keep it in my hands while texting , I mean it has great graphics and beautiful display but the texting is all over the place with adding punctuation where I don't want it and not spacing words unless hitting spacebar twice .
- The battery dies out quickly too . However , I am sure that is my fault because I have so many messenger apps and my screen is always at 100% brightness .
- Cumbersome volume and power buttons on back of phone . I will never buy another handset with buttons on the back . Related to the point before , it is very difficult to do a screenshot ( pressing volume down and power button at same time ) . No missed call or message notifications stay on the screen when the phone is locked .
- First issue that started to occur was it's inability to turn the screen back on during a phone call . Now I must wait for the other person to hang up and if I get a voice mail I need to pull the battery . Second problem occurred with the screen . Somehow a white frost like ring has developed around the screen . It becomes more serious with a lower brightness setting .
- When I linked Bluetooth to my car ( latest Cadillac ) to listen music , the sound likes to be blocked , blurred and volume is very small , I have to turn volume to maximum . I tried with different music players , all are same effect . I speculate it is LG's Bluetooth transmitter is with problem .
- overheats after over 7 min of use , overheating leads to lag / sluggish performance and plastic , cheap feel
- good for money but messes up with hangouts android .
