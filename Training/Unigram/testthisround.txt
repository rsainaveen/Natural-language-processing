+ Have not had any issues with this phone ! Got it for $1 too !
+ EXCELLENT smartphone . I'd owned several Galaxy phones , one I used with an AT & T service that was buggy to defective ; and the other two through Verizon that simply did not perform up to snuff . The hardware , specifically the male power port , gave way due to my habit of using the phone while charging . . . which tugs and damages the connection pin . . . I had been using an LG LTE , which was economical and sufficiently functional , except the photography function was poor . My mobile phone guy ( a Pageplus dealer ) recommended the LG G3 .
+ I've been using this phone for about a year now . Its been great so far and it runs very smooth . I usually have multiple apps open at once and the battery life is still great . I was drawn to the gold version because it seems unique as i haven't seen phones in this color before . The camera takes high quality photos . I love that the power and volume rocker buttons are on the back , it makes it easier to press them . My only complaint is that I wish the headphone jack was on the top of the phone rather than the bottom .
+ This cell was almost in mint condition . Refreshing to see .
+ I've been using this phone for over a year now and I still have no desire to upgrade . The phone has all of the features that the iPhone 6s just added without the added length on the phone . As well this still has the highest quality mobile screen that you could ask for . Amazing phone !
+ I love this device even though I've never actually used it as a phone . If that sounds a little crazy , let me explain . I don't like phablets- I think they are silly : )- for me the iPhone 5S is the perfect size ; I don't know what I'm going to do when it's obsolete- maybe sanity will prevail and " small " phones will make a comeback . However , I was also bitten by the VR bug- and for this the iPhone 5S is woefully inadequate: Retina display is normally great but when magnified it looks terrible . I needed something with a better display at a reasonable price . This LG has a fabulous QuadHD display that looks great in a VR viewer . So I can't comment on its qualities as a giant phone but as a wireless device for playing music , podcasts , and especially 3D VR content , it is simply outstanding . That is until the Oculus Rift is released . At that time I'll be putting it up on eBay .
+ This is the best smartphone I have owned so far . That would be LG g3 > htc one-x > iPhone 4 . The best feature by far is the ability to edit / change the touch buttons for back , home , and active apps . You can change their locations and their icons .
+ Ok so far so good I have had this for about an hour and MAN I'm happy ! I didn't want to upgrade and pay upgrade fees to Verizon or give them more money they annoy me so I held my breathe and I ordered this fully prepared to be annoyed and regret my purchase but so far this device is EXCELLENT they even sent a charger .
+ Absolutely in love with this phone ! Great pic quality ( and I take a lot of pics ) , durability , battery life , it looks great and has the cost wasn't that bad ! Would definitely recommend !
+ Very nice phone . Would highly recommend . Perfect screen size and beautiful display . And having the buttons in the back was a little awkward at first , but is very comfortable to use . It also came days early , which had me very excited .
+ This screen protector is awesome . I have applied quite a few over the years but this was by far the easiest . Now that it's on , it is completely invisible . It was definitely worth the extra few dollars .
+ absolutely fantastic phone . best phone on the market . note , galaxy , iphone , etc doesnt compare . this phone is superior in all ways . im amazed i got this phone for under $600 . . .
+ Works great , multitasking is really good , phone is just beautiful and one of the best looking hands down . This is my frist LG phone im coming from a Samsung Galaxy S5 and i happy i looked into LG . This is money well spent
+ Awesome Phone , was a little big at first but i got used to that super fast . Bought it refurbished and couldn't be happier . The price was better , and there are zero problems with the phone . No scratches , and the phone runs perfectly .
+ I love love love this phone . I paid $280 for it on Prime Day , as a Warehouse Deal , and I'd do it again in a heartbeat . It works perfectly and I love a lot of LGs features . The IR blaster has been so much fun to use , and I love being able to tap my security knock on the black screen to wake the phone up and unlock it at the same time . LG did a lot right with this phone
+ Fantastic phone ! Delivered on time and the replacement had zero issues ! Buy this and you will never look back . Highly recommend this product ! Easy setup and DOES work for verizon users !
+ I just got this phone today and wanted to let anyone know that might be wanting to use it on one of the BYOD or BYOP services . It appears that it works on Tracfone since they approved it immediately . I have ordered the sim for it for $10 ( micro ) , and hope for the best . I have been using Tracfone for about 2 years , and have upgraded to this phone . If you are not a heavy user like me this might interest you . I haven't found much letting anyone know that this particular phone works on their service , but evidently it does . I'll update if I have any problems , but don't expect to .
+ Nice phone which I could get unlocked the day I received it . I like the size and the phone works well . There was a good deal going on when I bought it and hence the 5 stars on this review .
+ I upgraded my LG G2 to this LG G3 . So this is more of a comparison . This phone is a bit larger in width and height-Good thingIt has a removable battery ( unlike the sealed G2 ) . Battery life doesn't seem to last as long for sure . ( good thing you can buy and have a back-up )
+ 1 Month Review: I bought this phone after my LG G2 had taken a hard fall and stopped working , and I have got to say i'm glad i stuck with LG . The LG G3 Is an amazing device with a beautiful 1440p display and suprisingly a great battery life considering its powering a 5 . 5 inch 1440p display . The overall design of this beast is amazing . It fits well in the hand and just looks amazing . The durability of this phone is also way better than the G2 . Watching videos on this phone is just breathtaking . Back to battery life , with a low usage I can last all the way till 11 at night ( I unplug at 6:30 a . m roughly ) . With a more moderate to heavy use i can last all day to about 5 with 4 hours of onscreen time at 50% brightness . Overall a sexy fast and amazing product . Thank you LG
+ The phone I received was in New like quality . I was very impressed with the phone and the battery seem to hold a charge well so I am impressed with that too . The charger though was a slow charger and slightly damaged . Even though they warn you the charger would not be the one from the box , I felt that was a bit cheap . Still , I wanted a good phone and got an almost New one so I have them five stars .
+ Absolutely amazing phone , even with today's " new and improved " more recent devices , this phone is more than up to the task . I can't recall it ever stuttering , the battery life is better than my iPhone 6 , and the display is gorgeous . If you don't like the LG skin over the software , just download a new launcher , I mean it is running Android . I love the ability to customize one handed use options , and especially the soft keys and their functions at the bottom . Android L was made for this beast . I don't think I will ever move back from LG !
+ This phone is fantastic ! It is speedy , light , comfortable , large , and lasts forever . I bought it new from AT & T , and have loved it since I unboxed it . I've had a history with lots of phones , but this one is my favorite . The worst issue is with onscreen text sometimes appearingto be blurry , due tosuper high resolution . In other words , the phone is TOO good . : ) Much better than the S5 in every aspect , and the camera is amazing . Must buy .
+ Screen is fantastic . True , vibrant colors . Very crisp . when storage . Ui is simple yet thorough . Top notch specs . Games run very fluid . Battery life is great . Gets me through an 11 hour day as a car salesman making 30+ phone calls a day and much web browsing .
+ Excelent phone ! ! I use it all the time .
- I just didn't care for it , don't really know why the battery run down kind of fast but it probably was my apps and how I was using it . went to a droid turbo and like it
- This phone broke after I had it 7 months or so . Despite Sprint and LG admitting it was a warranty issue , neither LG or Sprint would repair it .
- Excellent hardware specs , poor durability . Dropped it from 2 feet and the screen shattered . Really , it shattered . Completely unusable .
- The pattern was spliced all the way across the cover adv bout an inch from the top of the phone .
- Terrible autocorrect . I've tried the LG keyboard and 9 other Android keyboards ; and none come close to the intelligence of the iPhone . How can LG issue a phone that cannot even put an apostrophe in words like " didn't " , " I'm " , " it's " , " hasn't " ? ? I thought with time that the phone would quickly learn the right words ; two months later , that hasn't happened . No mute button on the exterior of the phone .
- Defective phone ! The audio Jack icon kept appearing and volumen could NOT BE HEARD !
- Burn screen p they offer my money back but i keep the phone anyway good phone
- Great phone , but it's not unlocked . I bought it before shipping out to an overseas posting , only to find that the local SIM wouldn't work without an unlock code . It is taking long , complicated , frustrating calls with AT & T to get this worked out .
- After 1 week , phone randomly reboots . Hard reset 3 times . Disabled several Google apps , Verizon and Lg bloatware . Hoping this solves problem or phone is going back . Disappointed Lg doesn't hasn't updated to kit Kat 4 . 4 . 4 . Wife has Motorola phone that gets latest updates quickly . Lg better hire more software engineers if it wants to compete in very competitive cell phone market . . .
- Has glitches . Such as shutting off randomly & unlocking / locking randomly . Will turn some features randomly by itself . Battery life is efficient however . & can be fast when it wants .
- The screen broke with one drop while in a case . A co-worker had the same issue with it . The gorilla glass is not that strong . Other than that , a good phone .
- good for money but messes up with hangouts android .
- Used it as main line phone for a month , didn't like it at all . . . now is my second line , hardly used .
- The battery stopped working after the first time used
- Poor battery life , low quality of photo , cannot even store picture time stamp in the phone right , the time stamp is always wrong . I switched from iPhone 4s to this one , thought just read the online document , it would be not big deal for either iPhone or Android phone . Oh , yes , the photos I removed from the phone would come back on the second day or two , pretty annoying . right now it worth only one cent , you would waste more money in a long run . what a joke !
- It's a piece of shit . if I cover up the camera and try to turn it on it'll flash on and off and it won't turn on in the dark it spazes out . . . I've had it for about a week and a half ya it has its perks but it's still not a very good phone
- I was hoping that it would be better than the Galaxy S3 I had previously had . It's a big dissapointment . for instance I miss the ease of txting on the galaxy and certain apps will not down load to the LG3 like Credit Karma . I was hoping for an upgrade and recieved a down grade in my eyes . Even the camera is not as good as I hoped .
- I tried the phone at the at & t store and was surprised by all the positive reviews about the screen . It's the worest among all the phones that I had , and I had many , including the LG G pro and HTC One M8 . Specification wise is a great pone , but in reality , a bad overpriced phone .
- The phone seems to be immature and needs to focus more on its shortcuts and user friendliness . Seems like um always pressing the back button and the exterior of the phone is so darn slippery And can't hardly keep it in my hands while texting , I mean it has great graphics and beautiful display but the texting is all over the place with adding punctuation where I don't want it and not spacing words unless hitting spacebar twice .
- The battery dies out quickly too . However , I am sure that is my fault because I have so many messenger apps and my screen is always at 100% brightness .
- Cumbersome volume and power buttons on back of phone . I will never buy another handset with buttons on the back . Related to the point before , it is very difficult to do a screenshot ( pressing volume down and power button at same time ) . No missed call or message notifications stay on the screen when the phone is locked .
- First issue that started to occur was it's inability to turn the screen back on during a phone call . Now I must wait for the other person to hang up and if I get a voice mail I need to pull the battery . Second problem occurred with the screen . Somehow a white frost like ring has developed around the screen . It becomes more serious with a lower brightness setting .
- When I linked Bluetooth to my car ( latest Cadillac ) to listen music , the sound likes to be blocked , blurred and volume is very small , I have to turn volume to maximum . I tried with different music players , all are same effect . I speculate it is LG's Bluetooth transmitter is with problem .
- overheats after over 7 min of use , overheating leads to lag / sluggish performance and plastic , cheap feel
- good for money but messes up with hangouts android .
